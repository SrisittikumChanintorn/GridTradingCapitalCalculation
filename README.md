## 🧠 Purpose of This Tool  
This program is designed to calculate the minimum capital required for executing a grid trading strategy.  
It helps determine how much investment is needed based on the zones and strategies you define.

## ⚙️ What is Grid Trading?  
Grid Trading is a strategy that aims to generate profit without predicting price direction.  
Instead of relying on stop-losses, it allocates full capital at predefined price levels.  
The key idea is to hold positions until the price returns to profitable zones — making it particularly suitable for sideways markets or fundamentally strong assets (where the chance of the price dropping to zero is minimal).

This program simulates the **KZM** technique to split strategies within the same asset into two distinct approaches:

- **Fund A**: Long-term positions with wider intervals and larger position sizes.  
- **Fund B**: Short-term trades with smaller positions, aiming for quicker but smaller profits.

---

## 🧭 Basic Workflow

- **Choose an Asset** – One that is fundamentally strong and unlikely to collapse in value.  
- **Set Price Boundaries** – Define the expected upper and lower bounds of the asset’s price range.  
- **Define Number of Zones** – For both Fund A and Fund B, determine how many entry levels to place.  
- **Specify Lot Sizes** – Decide how much to invest at each level for each strategy.

## 💡 Strategy Notes  
Grid Trading in its original form is designed to minimize risk.  
While returns are often modest and stable, the strategy aims to preserve capital and deliver linear returns over time.

It is often used for:

- 📈 Long-term profit planning with steady, low-risk returns.  
- 🧪 Gaining trading experience while focusing on survival and consistency.  
- 🔁 Reinvesting gains into higher-risk speculative assets or developing additional strategies.
